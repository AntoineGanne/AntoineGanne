Graduated from Polytech Lyon. I'm now a *software engineer!*

Also, I'd love to help on an open-source project!

Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn or here on Github.

# Projects I worked on
![projects images](https://i.imgur.com/I5HGYZP.jpg)

## Back-end

I acquired  strong skills in back-end development by building APIs throughout school and internships.
My most recent experience are python APis using Flask (not public) to apply Machine Learning models.

## Full-Stack
Playroom is an ambitious school project aimed to make a framework of multiplayer web games in rooms (you only need the room code to join, like Jackbox Party packs).
We made the front with Vue.js and the back with Node.js. 
We managed to have a functionnal pictionnary!

## Data and Machine Learning
I'm very interested in Data Engineering because I enjoy thinking about the best ways to store information. 
I master SQL and I built a database storing geographical data during my internship at Sogeti.

I worked on data extraction and cleaning (using Talend) on reported UFO sightings  (NUFORC database).
Here's an example of the reported UFOs' shapes üõ∏

Various experiences in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

## Unity
Learned Unity for my internship in Tokyo where I worked on Sigverse, a framework for Human-Robot Interaction experiences in Virtual Reality.

I'm happy about my [Multi-Agent project](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/-5A-INFO-SMA-project) where agents are crowded in a grid and each agent try to go to a specific tile. In this case Unity was so helpful to deal with multi-threading.

 
## C#

Before working on Unity, I made a few school C# games like a [connect-4](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Le_Puissance4_Par_Antoine_et_Lea)

## Continuous Integration ( CI )
I had school and work experience with Continuous Integration using Gitlab CI and Docker üê≥. 

I'm Proud of [this project](https://gitlab.com/Ton_Ami/api_cloud_5a_info): a REST API where I was in charge of the autonomous deployment on a cloud service (CleverCloud) 

## Mathematics and optimization
I have a strong affinity for complexity analysis of different algorithms. 
Here is my [discete optimization project](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Optimisation-discrete) where I tested different algorithms about the quadratic assignment problem.

## Creative coding
I enjoy creating visual animations using code! 

I greatly appreciate the Processing foundation strive for inclusiveness in the tech industry. 
I extensively use P5 ([blendmode](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Having-fun-with-p5js-s-blendMode-), [circle](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/circle_and_lines) ) and write templates for p5 sketches: [gif_making](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Empty_Gif_Making_Sketch_for_p5.js), [video_recording](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Template_p5_video_recording)
