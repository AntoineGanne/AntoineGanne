# Projects I worked on
![projects images](https://i.imgur.com/I5HGYZP.jpg)

## Back-end

I acquired  strong skills in back-end development by building APIs throughout school and internships.
My most recent experience are python APis using Flask (not public) to apply Machine Learning models.

## Full-Stack
Playroom is an ambitious school prpject aimed to make a framework of multiplayer web games in rooms ( you only need the room code to join, like Jackbox Party packs).
We made the front with Vue.js and the back with Node.js. 
We managed to have a fuctionnal pictionnary!


## Data and Machine Learning
I'm very interested in Data Engineering because I enjoy thinking about the best ways to store information. 
I master SQL and I built a database storing geographical data during my internship at Sogeti.

I worked on data extraction and cleaning (using Talend) on reported ufo sightings  (NUFORC database).
Here's an exemple of the reported ufos' shapes üõ∏

Various experiences in Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

I highly recommend reading [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/) by Cathy O'Neil!

## Unity
Learned Unity for my internship in Tokyo where I worked on Sigverse, a framework for Human-Robot Interaction experiences in Virtual Reality.

I'm happy about my [Multi-Agent project](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/-5A-INFO-SMA-project) where agents are crowded in a grid and each agent try to go to a specific tile. In this case Unity was so helpful to deal with multi-threading.

 
## C#

Before working on Unity, I made a few school C# games like a [connect-4](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Le_Puissance4_Par_Antoine_et_Lea)

## Continuous Integration ( CI )
Had school and work experience with Continuous Integration using Gitlab CI and Docker üê≥. 

Proud of [this project](https://gitlab.com/Ton_Ami/api_cloud_5a_info): a REST API where I was in charge of the autonomous deployment on a cloud service (CleverCloud) 

## Mathematics and Graph Theory 

## Creative coding
I enjoy creating visual animations using code! 

I greatly appreciate the Processing foundation strive for inclusiveness in the tech industry. 
I extensively use P5 ([blendmode](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Having-fun-with-p5js-s-blendMode-), [circle](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/circle_and_lines) ) and write templates for p5 sketches: [gif_making](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Empty_Gif_Making_Sketch_for_p5.js), [video_recording](https://github.com/AntoineGanne/Template_p5_video_recording)
