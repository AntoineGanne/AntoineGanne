I have strong skills in back-end development.
Most recent experience are python APis using Flask (not public) and I did enough JEE APIs to be sick of this tech ðŸ‘€

## Full-Stack
Playroom is an ambitious school prpject aimed to make a framework of multiplayer web games in rooms ( you only need the room code to join, like Jackbox Party packs).
We made the front with Vue.js and the back with Node.js. 
We managed to have a fuctionnal pictionnary!
